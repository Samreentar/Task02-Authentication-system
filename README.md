***Authentication System***

Welcome to the Authentication System project. This robust and secure system enables users to create personal accounts by signing up with their name, email, and password. User credentials are securely stored in a MySQL database to ensure data integrity and privacy. Upon successful registration, users can log in using their email and password, granting them access to the protected home page. This project demonstrates a seamless integration of React.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, with MySQL as the database solution, providing a full-stack authentication system that is both efficient and user-friendly.
